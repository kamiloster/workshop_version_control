1. Introduction

This session is a second part for the workshop organised on the 10th February 2021: Version Control in a team with Git and GitHub.
Today, we will focus more on pratical aspects: some of the best practices in working in a team.
Attendees are divided into 4 groups (namely feature 1, feature 2, feature 3 and feature 4) so that we can simulate a team's working environment.
Below, instructions for each group are included.

3. Instructions
	a) Feature 1: Cultural differences between two countries.

	Please read the instruction entirely before doing any changes.
	
	I would like you to add a new section at the bottom which will discuss 3 of the cultural differences between some of the two countries (write something interesting about 
	these differences!). Add some title before writing anything up - easier to keep stuff tidy. 
	It should be fairly simple for you to work it out. If you really can't think of anything - write anything.
	
	Remember what I said earlier? Commit as often as possible, fetch as often as possible, check for differences, and communicate. We want to prevent conflicts, right?!
	This is a great opportunity for you to practice committing - after each difference. So you should have 3 commits at least.
	
	When you're done, feel free to open a pull request - don't forget to write comment in the pull request so I know what's up!
	
	When you're done with that, I will review your request. Make sure to come back to the repo and check whether I require more from you!
	
	I believe you will be able to take it from here, right?
	
	b) Feature 2: Differences between Matlab and Python
	
	Please read the instruction entirely first before doing any changes.
	
	I would like you to add a new section at the bottom which will discuss 3 of the differences between Matlab and Python (write something a bit more about these differences 
	than just listing them). Add some title before writing anything up - easier to keep stuff tidy.

	c) Feature 3: Differences between AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine
	
	Please read the instruction entirely first before doing any changes.
	
	I would like you to add a new section at the bottom which will discuss 3 of the differences between Covid-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca (write something a 
	bit more about these differences than just listing them). Add some title before writing anything up - easier to keep stuff tidy. 
	It should be fairly simple for you to work it out. If you really can't think of anything - write anything.

	Please read the instruction entirely first before doing any changes.
	
	I would like you to add a new section at the bottom which will discuss 3 of the advantages and/or disadvantages of working from home (write something a 
	bit more about these differences than just listing them). Add some title before writing anything up - easier to keep stuff tidy.
